:Backend notes
	- Yesterday created the logging interface
	- Has 4 functions, error, warn, trace, info
	- All of the functions are pretty much the same right now
	- Created the functions to produce the log-map of data, in the future this can be routed to a logging application such as Riemann
	- Functions all pass their maps to log-handler, which currently only spits out to file but will be able to send the maps elsewhere at a later
	date


:Frontend notes
	- Added a log statement to check-user-login for a successful login, hopefully this will be the first logging statement!



:Database notes


:General
	- Sent logs just to time-lord route due to I/O exception that I don't want to chase yet
	- Updated the main project so that logging_interface can now be used
