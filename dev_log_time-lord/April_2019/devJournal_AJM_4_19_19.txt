:Backend notes
	- Needed to specify a relative path in Spit in order to get the logs to write to a different directory. So spit takes a path relative to the project OR an absolute path for files
	- Can use Java (System/getenv "HOME") or something similar in the future to put logs in a place that users can access them
	- Currently writing logs to logging_interface/logs/
	- Split apart logging code a bit more, now setting a variable for the log path, then adding the log file to it
	- Also now sending the log-map to log-handler and destructuring to get the :severity key. This is now used to send log entries to the appropriate file.
	- Updated log-handler with a wish list function. Would like to be able to automatically check the directory for log size and rename them when they get too big
	- Will also want to split logs into different directories so they aren't all in one. This should be a short update to the log path
