:Database notes
	- Created a map for the DB schema in the clojure project at timelord.timelord_db.db_schema.clj
	- Intention is that this may make it easier for data to be put into the DB based on the table and column structure?
	- Not sure how to be DRY regarding this....seems like there will be several functions where if the DB structure changes there will be a lot of work that needs to be done to make sure that data is going into the db successfully, specifically regarding columns.


:General
	- Updated all of my journal files with my name, including the template I have been using and the table schema that I created to prepare for uploading to GitHub
	- Hopefully this will help other folks to be able to find out what I've done/get information about the project
	- on the list:
		- Create an actual DB document that describes what each table/column is the best that I can, including default behaviors
