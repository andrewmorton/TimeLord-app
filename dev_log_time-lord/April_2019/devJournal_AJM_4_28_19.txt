:Backend notes
	- Refactored Auth a bit, now checks username and password and returns a map if checks are successful
	- condensed validate-login-credentials a bit as well
	- updated the invalid login and password functions to be a bit more condensed
	- decided to forego the JDBI for now and will try to just get the first instance of the app up with clojure's jdbc
	- Still am having a bit of difficulty with prepared selects, this will be something that I'll have to work on and tighten up in later iterations

:Database notes
	- Updated the DB schema, can use (some #{column-name} db-schema) to pull back column names from the schema
	- The above is clunky, and I can do better, but I'd like a way to represent the db as a data structure to make updating it easier
	- Updated the DB interface a bit, created a basic select statement, then created a select-user statement to use for the login screen
