:Backend notes
	- Created logic checking for username and password on check-user page
	- if check-user page encounters an error with username or password, then returns the user to login page with an error appended to the bottom of the page
	- Created functions invalid-username and invalid-password that check password and username according to same parameters of Javascript form checking
	- Added these functions to the check-user page function

:Frontend notes
	- added JavaScript to login page so that attributes of the username and password will be readonly if JavaScript is disabled
	- Added JavaScript to freeze username and password inputs so id cannot be changed using JavaScript (would get around JavaScript Validation)
