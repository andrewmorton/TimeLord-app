:Backend notes


:Frontend notes
	- changed header function back to simple header
	- May require (hiccup.page/html5) in order to actually put out the way that I was planning
	- Added middleware rind.middleware.params to run-app, but it doesn't seem to have made a difference
	- Frontend interface is serving pages just fine, but I can't get at the POST data on the login form
	- GET data will provide the query string just fine
	- Started a regexp to provide an error if the username provided contains any special characters 

:Database notes


:General
	- Seems that Ring doesn't provide POST params by default
