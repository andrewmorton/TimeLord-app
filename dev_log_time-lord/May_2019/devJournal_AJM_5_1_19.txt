:Backend notes
	- Changed up the check user login function in web-build
	- Split the function up between valid-credentials? and valid-login-with-db?
	- New functions handle the redirects and the logging using auth
	- Still need to make the db functions to check info in the db for the login
	- also removed an unnecessary function in auth, the 2 new web-build functions basically do the same but better and are easier to follow
	

:Frontend notes
	- need to create a new invalid login page for when a user logs in with the wrong password

:Database notes
	- Need to create auth/db-username? which returns true if the username exists in the db
	- Need to create auth/db-password-matches? which returns true if the password supplied matches the hash in the db
